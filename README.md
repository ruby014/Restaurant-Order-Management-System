# Restaurant-Order-Management-System

Developed as the final project for my Object-Oriented Programming course, this C++ application provides an efficient order management system for restaurant waitstaff. It features a dynamic menu system that loads food and drink items from structured input files, enabling waiters to seamlessly take and process customer orders. The application ensures accurate order tracking, automates bill generation, and maintains organized records by saving detailed receipts as well-formatted text files upon order completion.
